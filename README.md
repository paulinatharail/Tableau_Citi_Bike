<b>Top start and end stations</b><br>
    The Treemap indicates the various start and stop stations for Citi Bikes from Mar 2018 - Feb 2019.The size of the rectangles and the concentration of the color indicates a higher number of rides for the corresponding two stations. The treemap is interactive - ie on mouse hover, the bar charts below displays 
    the data for the selected combination of stations. 

    Likewise, if the cursor hovers over any of the stations in the bar chart, the corresponding start or stop stations is indicated in the neighboring chart. The Treemap also changes to show the possible combinations for that station.
     

<b>Peak hours (Summer vs. Winter)</b><br>
    The chart compares the peak usage hours of Citi Bike during the summer and winter. As evidenced, the number of rentals is more in the summer but the peak hours (8am and 6pm) are the same irrespective of the season indicating that the bikes maybe used to commute to work.


<b>Bike rentals by Gender and Age</b><br>
     The chart illustrates the number of rentals broken down by gender and age over the last year. The data shows that there are 3-4 times more men than women renting the bikes. The age groups of 20-25 and 45-50 (both men and women) ride more than the other age ranges.
