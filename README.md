# Tableau_Citi_Bike
<h3>Summary</h3><br>
    Citi Bike's trip history data files were downloaded for the period (Mar 2018 - Feb 2019). These individual files were unioned to create a single dataset. Few calculated fields were computed to create the visualizations.
<br>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>
<b>Top start and end stations</b><br>
    The Treemap indicates the various start and stop stations for Citi Bikes from Mar 2018 - Feb 2019.The size of the rectangles and the concentration of the color corresponds to the number of rides from/to the stations. The treemap is interactive - ie on mouse hover, the bar charts below displays 
    the information for the selected combination of stations. Similarly, if the cursor hovers over any of the stations in the bar chart, the corresponding start or end stations is indicated in the neighboring chart. The Treemap also changes to show the possible combinations for that station. 
<br> 

<b>Popular stations over time</b><br>     
    This map shows the station popularity over time (quarter). The size and color density of the marker indicates the number of rides from the station. Starting stations are indicated in green and the ending stations are indicated in orange. The Fall season seems to be the busiest season for bike rentals.
<br> 

<b>Peak hours (Summer vs. Winter)</b><br>
    The chart compares the peak usage hours of Citi Bike during the summer and winter. As evidenced, the number of rentals is more in the summer but the peak hours (8am and 6pm) are the same irrespective of the season indicating that the bikes maybe used to commute to work.
<br> 

<b>Bike rentals by Gender and Age</b><br>
     The chart illustrates the number of rentals broken down by gender and age over the last year. The data shows that there are 3-4 times more men than women renting the bikes. The age groups of 20-25 and 45-50 (both men and women) ride more than the other age ranges. These charts are interactive enabling further drill-down of data.
<br> 

<b>Miles traveled (bike)</b><br>
     The chart lists the top 25 bikes (IDs) and the average miles traveled. The mileage was calculated per Citi Bike's mileage estimates. This can be used to identify which bike(s) need more repair.
